# Triple-quoted strings preserve leading and trailing whitespaces, 
# including newlines. This can be useful in situations where the exact
# formatting of the text matters.

# Multiline Strings:
# Triple-quoted strings are convenient when you want to create 
# strings that span multiple lines without having to use escape characters for line breaks. 
# This makes the code more readable and maintains the visual structure of the text.
